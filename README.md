Suitable location determination project for Electric Vehicle Charging stations

As electric vehicles become increasingly popular, appropriate and strategic positioning of electric vehicle charging stations is important. This project aims to develop a new approach to optimize the location selection of electric vehicle charging stations. This new approach aims to determine the most suitable charging station locations by considering several variables such as environmental factors, user demands, infrastructure access, and energy resources.
